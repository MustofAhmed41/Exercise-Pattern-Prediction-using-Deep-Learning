# Exercise-Pattern-Prediction-using-Deep-Learning

Purpose of Project
------------

As the world is modernizing, we are spending more time
sitting at desks. It can lead to various other health-related
problems, which can be prevented by exercising. These exercises include walking, jogging, weight lifting etc. Exercises
like weight lifting can lead to multiple sprains, strains, or
fractures if they are not done correctly. Learning how to
do them correctly requires supervision from gym experts.
But in our busy lives, we barely have time to go to the
gym. So in our study, we are exploring whether we can
predict if a person is exercising correctly or not
by analyzing data collected from various sensors attached
to the user as they exercise. Previous authors havenâ€™t explored the deep
learning approach, so in our study, we set out to find if
using deep learning can be a feasible option or not for
predicting if a user is correctly exercising or not.
